<a name="trapgrid" class="anchor" href="#trapgrid"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TrapGrid</h2>

<p>TrapGrid simulates insect dispersal in a rectangular area containing traps. Each trap has a parameter indicating its attractiveness. Using this value, the escape probability for a given insect at a given distance from the trap can be calculated.</p>

<p>An outbreak is determined by a quantity of insects released at a given point and having a certain diffusion coefficient. The simulation can be run for any number of days, and will calculate the daily average escape probability for the colony, as well as a cumulative escape probability.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p><code>java -jar TrapGrid.jar &lt;TrapGrid file&gt; [-ob &lt;outbreak file&gt;] [-nd &lt;number of days&gt;] [-ns &lt;number of simulations&gt;] [-nf &lt;number of flies per outbreak&gt;] [-dc &lt;diffusion coefficient&gt;] [-s &lt;seed for random number generator&gt;] [-t &lt;tolerance for TrapGrid average escape probability calculator&gt;] [--calculateAvgEscProb]</code></p>

<h3>
<a name="trapgrid-file" class="anchor" href="#trapgrid-file"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TrapGrid file</h3>

<p>A TrapGrid file is a tab-delimited file. The first row should contain x and y values representing the upper-right corner of a rectangle (whose lower-left corner is (0,0)). Each subsequent line should have three entries -- x, y and lambda representing the position and attractiveness of each trap. </p>

<h3>
<a name="other-inputs" class="anchor" href="#other-inputs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other inputs</h3>

<p>You may supply an optional Outbreak file, which is a two-column tab-delimited file containing the x and y locations of outbreaks to be simulated. If you provide this file, the program will run one simulation per location.</p>

<p>The last flag, '--calculateAvgEscProb', enables calculation of the grid's overall average escape probability. Depending on the size of the area in question, this calculation can be time-consuming, and of course does not need to be repeated for multiple runs using the same grid.</p>

<h3>
<a name="output" class="anchor" href="#output"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output</h3>

<p>TrapGrid writes to stdout. It will print a summary of the grid and other parameters used, along with a table. The table gives Outbreak Location, Day and Cumulative Escape Probability for each day of each outbreak simulated.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sample-data" class="anchor" href="#sample-data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sample data</h3>

<p>The repository ships with a sample TrapGrid file called 'foogrid'. Running the program as follows:</p>

<p><code>java -jar TrapGrid.jar -tg foogrid</code></p>

<p>will run a simulation of a single outbreak consisting of 500 files in a 100m by 100m grid.</p>
